ARGOS project, image classification [Machine Learning - 2017]
=======

This is a project for Machine Learning course of Master's degree, Engineering in Computer Science.

The ARGOS system (Automatic Remote Grand Canal Observation System) has the goal to control the
boats' traffic in Venice's Grand Canal, using 13 observation posts (Survey Cells) distributed along a waterway of about 6 km length and 80-150 meters width.

For this project, our scope is related to image classification task: given different screenshots taken by the cells, classify correctly the boats that appear in them.
